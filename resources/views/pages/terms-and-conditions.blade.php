                            <p class="text-neutral-500 tw-leading-212 tw-mb-2">Effective Date: 13th August 2025</p>

                            <p class="text-neutral-500 tw-leading-212 tw-mb-2">Welcome to Fortuner Ltd. These Terms & Conditions explain how we operate, how you can place orders with us, and what you can expect when doing business with us. By using our website or purchasing our products, you agree to these terms.</p>

                            <h3 class="my-2">About Fortuner Ltd</h3>
                            <p class="text-neutral-500 tw-leading-212 tw-mb-2">Fortuner Ltd supplies new, refurbished, and end-of-life IT hardware to businesses, IT professionals, and resellers worldwide. Our focus is on providing reliable technology backed by exceptional service, fast delivery, and secure transactions.</p>

                            <h3 class="my-2">Placing Orders</h3>
                            <p class="text-neutral-500 tw-leading-212 tw-mb-2">You can place orders through our website or by contacting our sales team directly. Once your order is placed, you will receive an order confirmation email with all the details. If a product you have ordered is unavailable or out of stock, we will contact you to offer a suitable alternative or a full refund. Bulk and custom orders may require a deposit or special payment terms, which will be agreed upon before processing.</p>

                            <h3 class="my-2">Pricing & Payment</h3>
                            <p class="text-neutral-500 tw-leading-212 tw-mb-2">All prices are displayed in [currency] and may or may not include VAT, depending on your location and the nature of your order. We accept secure payments through Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, bank transfers, and other approved methods. Payments must be completed in full before we dispatch your order. We believe in transparent pricing, so you will never encounter hidden charges or unexpected fees.</p>

                            <h3 class="my-2">Shipping & Delivery</h3>
                            <p class="text-neutral-500 tw-leading-212 tw-mb-2">We offer same-day dispatch for in-stock items ordered before our daily cutoff time. Next-day delivery is available within the UK and selected regions, and we also ship internationally to major destinations. All orders are shipped with tracking and insurance for your peace of mind. While we aim to deliver within the stated timeframes, delays can sometimes occur due to courier issues, customs clearance, or other factors beyond our control.</p>

                            <h3 class="my-2">Returns & Refunds</h3>
                            <p class="text-neutral-500 tw-leading-212 tw-mb-2">Your satisfaction matters to us. If you wish to return a product, please contact our support team first to arrange the process. Returned items must be in their original condition and packaging. Once we receive and inspect the returned product, we will issue a prompt refund or send a replacement. Please note that certain products, such as special or custom orders, may be non-returnable, and we will inform you of this before your purchase.</p>

                            <h3 class="my-2">Product Quality & Warranty</h3>
                            <p class="text-neutral-500 tw-leading-212 tw-mb-2">We thoroughly test and certify all our products, whether new or refurbished, before they are shipped. Warranty coverage will vary depending on the product and will be confirmed at the time of sale. Our warranty covers manufacturing and hardware defects but does not cover damage caused by misuse, accidents, or unauthorized repairs.</p>

                            <h3 class="my-2">Your Responsibilities</h3>

We are also not liable for losses caused by improper installation, misuse, or damage to products after delivery, nor for indirect or consequential damages.</p>
